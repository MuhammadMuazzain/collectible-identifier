# MarketMaster: Real-Time Collectible Recognition Mobile Application

## About
I built MarketMaster as a real-time computer vision mobile application that uses the phone camera to recognize physical collectible items and instantly surface relevant market information and contextual data overlays. This project is my personal portfolio piece, showcasing my skills in Android development, TensorFlow Lite integration, and object detection.

## Getting Started

### Steps to Build and Run the App
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client or via command line.
2. Open the project with Android Studio (version Bumblebee or newer recommended).
3. Make sure all dependencies are synced properly with the project by checking the `build.gradle` files.
4. Connect an Android device or set up an emulator through Android Studio's AVD Manager.
5. Build the project by selecting 'Build -> Make Project' in the Android Studio menu.
6. Run the application by clicking on the 'Run -> Run 'app'' option and select the connected device or an emulator.

### Assumptions Made
- User has an Android device running on Android-Q or above
- It is assumed that the user's device has a camera that is compatible with the CameraX API.
- The user has basic understanding of how to operate an Android application.
- The device has sufficient storage to save snapshots taken during object detection.

## Features

MarketMaster leverages the power of TensorFlow Lite to identify objects in real-time through the device's camera. It includes several features and customizations that provide users with a seamless and interactive object detection experience, such as:

* Real-time object recognition using TensorFlow Lite
* Instantaneous display of market information and contextual data overlays
* Customizable UI for optimal user experience
